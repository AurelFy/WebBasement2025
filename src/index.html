    <p>Once upon a time, deep below the foggy peaks, lay a hidden tiny nation of tiny folks named Kaâz-Dûn. Long ago, this place was led by a unity of metal smiths and wise ones. Yet, old tales told of a chosen tiny king — one to unite all clans and ignite lost flame-halls.</p>

  <div class="chapter--first__text02">
    <p>Smallin, a young gold-melt lad, had no kin; an old man, Baldik, took him in. He had no coin, no big name. On his neck hung a cut emblem — a clue of lost past. Bold, tough, full of wish to seek unknown lands, Smallin longed to find paths all had left behind. Many found his hopes odd — "too tall a tale" — yet he kept his aim.</p>
