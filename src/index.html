      <p>Once upon a time, deep below the foggy peaks, lay a hidden tiny nation of tiny folks named Kaâz-Dûn. Long ago, this place was led by a unity of metal smiths and wise ones. Yet, old tales told of a chosen tiny king — one to unite all clans and ignite lost flame-halls.</p>

      <p>Smallin, a young gold-melt lad, had no kin; an old man, Baldik, took him in. He had no coin, no big name. On his neck hung a cut emblem — a clue of lost past. Bold, tough, full of wish to seek unknown lands, Smallin longed to find paths all had left behind. Many found his hopes odd — "too tall a tale" — yet he kept his aim.</p>

      <p>At the sun-peak feast of flames, all metal-folk lit up the old glow. Then, all shook. Deep within the holy spot, a black lump did split. In it lay Dakazûn — a tool of god-steel, one no soul could lift.
      On its side, old glyphs told: “Only kin of Un, the Stone Hand, may lift this tool.”</p>

      <p>Smallin set out: to find all old clans, win unity, build ties anew, and seek the lost hoop of Un, deep in the cave of An-Falhaz. On this path, he met foes, tangles of live stone, and facts : Smallin, the last of Un’s line, was saved as a babe to elude foes.</p>

      <p>The last clash took place in the Deep Glow Hall. With Dakazûn, Smallin led all in a link of axes. A vile soul — once like him, now lost — named Zulda, sought to melt land into a seat of ash.
        With&nbsp;bold soul, his guild, and the might of old kings in the tool, Smallin won. The old flame lit up anew — no vile touch did stay.</p>

      <p>He then got his hoop. King Smallin, Tool of Union, took the seat in joy, echoing in all halls.
        To this day, all flame-places sing his tag. All deep paths hum: “Tiny feet may fill big shoes, if led by a bold soul.”</p>
