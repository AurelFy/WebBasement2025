      <p>Once upon a time, deep below the foggy peaks, lay a hidden tiny nation of tiny folks named Kaâz-Dûn. Long ago, this place was led by a unity of metal smiths and wise ones. Yet, old tales told of a chosen tiny king — one to unite all clans and ignite lost flame-halls.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="chapter--first__text02 div--full">
      <p>Smallin, a young gold-melt lad, had no kin; an old man, Baldik, took him in. He had no coin, no big name. On his neck hung a cut emblem — a clue of lost past. Bold, tough, full of wish to seek unknown lands, Smallin longed to find paths all had left behind. Many found his hopes odd — "too tall a tale" — yet he kept his aim.</p>

    <div class="chapter--two__text01 div--full">
      <p>At the sun-peak feast of flames, all metal-folk lit up the old glow. Then, all shook. Deep within the holy spot, a black lump did split. In it lay Dakazûn — a tool of god-steel, one no soul could lift.
      On its side, old glyphs told: “Only kin of Un, the Stone Hand, may lift this tool.”</p>
    </div>

    <div class="chapter--two__text02 div--full">
      <p>The bold had no luck. Then Smallin, led by a deep call, held the shaft. Light flew! Heat sang! The tool flew to his palm. All went mute. The tiny king had come.</p>

      <p>Yet, evil had come to life. In pits of Udok, a vile being did wake. Odd foes — the Gogaks, shaped by hate and stone — came to seek the tool of might.</p>

  <section class="chapter--four">

    <div class="chapter--four__text01 div--full">
      <p>The last clash took place in the Deep Glow Hall. With Dakazûn, Smallin led all in a link of axes. A vile soul — once like him, now lost — named Zulda, sought to melt land into a seat of ash.
        With&nbsp;bold soul, his guild, and the might of old kings in the tool, Smallin won. The old flame lit up anew — no vile touch did stay.</p>
